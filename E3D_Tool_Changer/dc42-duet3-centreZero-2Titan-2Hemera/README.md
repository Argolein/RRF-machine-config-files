This file is for a standard E3D Tool Changer with Titan tools in docks 0 and 1, Hemera tools with tool boards in docks 2 and 3, running RepRapFirmware 3.01RC3 on Duet 3. See https://miscsolutions.wordpress.com/2020/03/02/converting-the-e3d-tool-changer-to-duet-3-with-hemera-tools-part-1/ for details.

The extruder jerk setting has not yet been optimised. Too low a setting results in slow printing when pressure advance is used. Too high a setting makes the Titan extruders noisy and may cause hot end jams.

X0 Y0 is at the centre of the bed.
