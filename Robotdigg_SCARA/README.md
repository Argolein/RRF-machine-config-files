These files are for a Robotdigg SCARA arm (https://www.robotdigg.com/product/929/Scara-Arm-3D-Printer) wth the following modifications:
- Electronics replaced by Duet Ethernet (but Duet WiFi would be more appropriate)
- Proximal and distal motors replace by 0.9deg motors (E3D "compact but powerful" range) for better resolution
- Distal arm belt drive chaged to GT2 belts, drive ratio changed
- Proximal homimg switch moved back to increase the rantge of the proximal arm
- Other mechanical enhancements as described at https://miscsolutions.wordpress.com/2017/09/24/improving-the-robotdigg-scara-printer/

X0 Y0 is approximately at the centre of the printable area, excluding the additional printable area gained by moving the proximal homing switch.

Tested with RRF 2.05.
