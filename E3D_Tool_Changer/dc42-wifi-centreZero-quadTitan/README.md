This file is for a standard E3D Tool Changer with quad Titan tools, running RepRapFirmware 3.01RC1 on a Duet WiFi + DueX5.

The extruder jerk setting has not yet been optimised. Too low a setting results in slow printing when pressure advance is used. Too high a setting makes the Titan extruders noisy and may cause hot end jams.

X0 Y0 is at the centre of the bed.
